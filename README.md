I'm starting "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021" course from Udemy. 
Since my goal is to master Python, I chose to take this course in the hope it would provide more structure and better guidance than I was getting while "self-learning". 
While taking part in this course, I have been taking notes and what-not and attempting all of the course projects to the best of my abilities. 
I'll be using this repo as a way for myself to access them as, if and when I need them. 100 projects in 100 days.
