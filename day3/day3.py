# Exercise 5

# Instructions
# ğŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ğŸ’ª
# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 
#A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 
#The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice.

# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
# on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
# unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder
# If english is not your first language or if the above logic is confusing, try using this flow chart .
# e.g. The year 2000:

# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)

# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)

# So the year 2000 is a leap year.

# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

# 2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)

# 2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

# 2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, including spelling an punctuation.

# Example Input 1
# 2400
# Example Output 1
# Leap year
# Example Input 2
# 1989
# Example Output 2
# Not leap year

print("Leap year checker")
# Which year do you want to check?
year = int(input())
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡

four = year % 4
hundred = year % 100
four_hundred = year % 400


if four == 0:
    if hundred == 0:
        if four_hundred == 0:

# Exercise 7
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

# "Your score is *z*."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times

# R occurs 1 time

# U occurs 2 times

# E occurs 2 times

# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time
